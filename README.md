# Save Old Glossop Campaign Microsite

## Overview

This project is a static React microsite designed to inform and mobilize the community regarding the development of three significant sites in Old Glossop. Our mission is to provide clear, accessible information about what's being proposed, the potential impacts of these developments, and how community members can voice their opinions and concerns.

### Purpose of the Microsite

- **Inform**: Present detailed information about each development site.
- **Engage**: Encourage community involvement and feedback.
- **Mobilize**: Provide resources for effective community action.

## Technical Overview

### Technology Stack

- **React**: Chosen for its efficiency in building user interfaces, React allows us to create a dynamic, single-page application that is both fast and responsive.
- **Mantine**: A modern React component library, Mantine is used for styling and layout, providing a cohesive look and feel across the microsite.
- **React Router**: Manages navigation within the application, enabling a single-page app experience with multiple views.

### Structure

1. **Homepage**: Features a hero section listing the three development sites, offering a clear entry point for users to explore detailed information about each site.

2. **Menu Section**: Allows easy navigation to different pages, each dedicated to one of the three sites. Each page covers:
    - What's proposed
    - Potential objections
    - How to participate in the discussion

3. **Site-Specific Pages**: Detailed information about each site, including proposed plans, potential impacts, and ways to get involved.

4. **About Us Page**: Introduces the team of volunteers behind this project, their motivations, and goals.

### Approach

The microsite is designed with simplicity and user engagement in mind. We aim to present information in a clear, concise manner, making it easy for visitors to understand the implications of each development and how they can contribute to the discussion. Interactivity and visual appeal are key, ensuring that the site is not only informative but also engaging.
